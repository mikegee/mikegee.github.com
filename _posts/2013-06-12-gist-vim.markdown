There's a bunch of good stuff in the is presentation by Chris Hunt: [Impressive Ruby Productivity with Vim and Tmux](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gB-JSh1EVME).  I want to implement most of what he's doing.

Let's start small.

[Gist-Vim](https://github.com/mattn/gist-vim) is vim plugin that can post the file you're editing to gist.github.com with one simple command.  It has every other feature you might want regarding gists.

Installation using Vundle is fairly straightforward.  [The instructions are in the README.](https://github.com/mattn/gist-vim#install-with-vundle)  I made the mistake of attempting to run `:BundleInstall` while still editing my `.vimrc.bundles`.  Turns out, you need to close and reopen vim to run `:BundleInstall`.

I might want to make it post the gist to [my employer](https://www.covermymeds.com)'s github enterprise installation.  To do so, just modify `github.apiurl` in `~/.gitconfig` ([implementation](https://github.com/mattn/gist-vim/blob/master/autoload/gist.vim#L33)).  I could also run `let g:github_api_url = 'http://your-github-enterprise-domain/api/v3'` within vim, [as documented here](https://github.com/mattn/gist-vim/blob/master/doc/gist-vim.txt#L155).
